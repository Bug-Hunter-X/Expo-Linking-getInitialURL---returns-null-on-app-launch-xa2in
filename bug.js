This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links, specifically when the app is launched from a deep link but the `Linking.getInitialURL()` method returns `null`. This can happen due to various reasons including the deep link not being properly formatted, an issue with the app's configuration in the Expo Go app or the Android/iOS manifest, or race conditions when the app is starting up.  The code below demonstrates a situation where the app waits for the `Linking.getInitialURL()` promise, but it resolves to null leading to unexpected behavior.
