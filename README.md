This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Expo `Linking` API's `getInitialURL()` method returning `null` when the app is launched from a deep link.  The bug is caused by a race condition or improper deep link configuration, preventing the app from correctly retrieving the initial URL. The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and potentially delaying the initial URL retrieval until the app is fully initialized.
